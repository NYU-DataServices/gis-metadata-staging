    "This point shapefile represents the birth location of Romanian artists from the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries. The data table includes both the birth and death locations and dates as well as the artists' nationality and art movement. The data was scraped from WikiArt.com. More about this project is available at https://lauxenos.hosting.nyu.edu/dhs/p/6/.  This data was collected as part of a student project for the NYU Abu Dhabi course Data and Human Space taught by David Wrisley during fall semester 2018. "
