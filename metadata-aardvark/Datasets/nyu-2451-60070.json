It represents the The Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) Train stations. PATH Train is a rail transit system that connects several cities in New Jersey to New York City. The unique id is station_id. This dataset is intended for researchers, policy makers, students, and educators for basic geographic analysis and mapping purposes. It was created by the GIS Lab at the Newman Library at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers series, so that members of the public could have access to well-documented and readily-usable GIS layers of NYC mass transit features.",
