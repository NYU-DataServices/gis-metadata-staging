    "This polygon layer is a combination of the county Census TIGER water files for all counties in the metro region; re-projected to local state plane. Its features and attributes are unmodified from the original file with the exception of the include field  - features with a value of 1 in this field were selected for inclusion in the coastal water layer (nyu_2451_34507), which was used to modify the boundaries of many of the layers in the dataset. The unique ID is hyrdoid; created by the Census. This data was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City."
