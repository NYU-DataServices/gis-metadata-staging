    "This point shapefile represents locations of more than 52,000 criminal homicides between the years 2008-2018 (approximately) in 50 of the largest American cities. The data includes the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in most cases, basic demographic information about each victim. Reporters from the Washington Post received data in many formats, including paper, and worked for months to clean and standardize it, comparing homicide counts and aggregate closure rates with FBI data to ensure the records were as accurate as possible. In some cases, departments provided only partial information about the homicides, so reporters consulted public records, including death certificates, court records and medical examiner reports, to fill in the gaps. The data is more specific than the federal homicide data gathered annually by the FBI from police agencies nationwide. The Post mapped each homicide, identifying arrest rates by geography in each city, sharing the analysis with the local police department prior to publication. This data was downloaded at the date of the data release and converted into a shapefile by NYU Data Services. The original data is available at: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/."
