    "This line layer is a combination of the Census TIGER roads files for counties, re-projected to local state plane. Portions of roads in neighboring New Jersey were also included, so that bridges do not appear to halt in the middle of rivers (where state boundaries touch). The mtfcc field contains Census MAT/TIGER Feature Class Codes that classify features by type. A number of duplicate features in Brooklyn and Queens (errors in the line files) were deleted so that the id fields for the roads could serve as unique identifiers. The unique ID is linearid; created by the census. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City."
