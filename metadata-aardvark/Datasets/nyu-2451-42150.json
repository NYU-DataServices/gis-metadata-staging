    "This polygon shapefile represents the causers of traffic accidents by type of accident in each of the seven emirates of the United Arab Emirates for 2002. The cause of accidents include turn overs, turn round collisions, collisions against animals, consecutive collisions, falls, head on collisions, motionless collisions, perpendicular collisions, run overs, and side collisions. The original dataset was collected by the UAE government and hosted on Bayanat.ae. It was joined to the UAE administrative district level 1 boundaries from the Global Administrative Areas database by Taylor Hixson in 2018. This dataset is only to be used for academic purposes."
