    "This line layer is an extract from NJ TRANSIT Rail, Light Rail, and Subway Currently Operated Right-of-Way lines, with connecting PATH and PATCO Rail downloaded from NJ Office of Information Technology , Office of Geographic Information Systems. It represents the The Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) Train routes. PATH Train is a rail transit system that connects several cities in New Jersey to New York City. The unique id is route_shor, which represents a shortened version of the route's name. This dataset is intended for researchers, policy makers, students, and educators for basic geographic analysis and mapping purposes. It was created by the GIS Lab at the Newman Library at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers series, so that members of the public could have access to well-documented and readily-usable GIS layers of NYC mass transit features."
