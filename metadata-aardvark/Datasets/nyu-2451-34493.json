    "This polygon layer is a subset of the Census TIGER landmark file, re-projected to local state plane and modified by subtracting a subset of the Census TIGER water layer (nyu_2451_34507) from it to create land-based boundaries. The largest and most culturally prominent features were selected to provide basic map reference and to cover up un-populated areas when making thematic maps. The NYC Dept of City Planning thematic maps for the 2010 Census were used for guidance in selecting features. Many of the features were modified from the original file: adjacent polygons were consolidated into larger ones, feature names were modified or updated, and in some cases polygons were created or reshaped. The unique ID is newid, created for this layer using the state county FIPS code and sequential numbers assigned to features in alphabetical order. This data was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City."
