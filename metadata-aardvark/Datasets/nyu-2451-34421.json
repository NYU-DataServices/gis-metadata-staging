    "This layer is a polygon theme representing state boundaries of India for 2001 and includes district socio-demographic Census attribute data such as total population, population by sex, and rural/urban populations. This data layer is sourced from secondary government sources (Survey of India, Census of India, Election Commission, etc) and includes data for 28 states. This layer is part of the Historical Boundaries of India dataset showing decadal change in state boundaries of India since 1951. This dataset is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for state level demographic analysis within basic applications to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data."
