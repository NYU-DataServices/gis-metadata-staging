    "This point shapefile represents natural sites in the United Arab Emirates. The data table is in Arabic and includes information about when the location was designated as a natural area and some of the tourist and leisure activities available there. This data was originally collected and hosted by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE). The data was accessed and downloaded from the MOCCAE's ArcGIS REST services directory in December 2018. The actual collection date and temporal coverage of the data is unknown and may vary. "
