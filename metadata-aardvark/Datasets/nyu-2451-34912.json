    "This geodatabase contains basic population and housing characteristics for townships in Argentina, collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos de la Republica Argentina (INDEC) as part of Argentina's Censo 2010. The data was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. The lowest administrative level represented in the census data collection is the township; the data includes 52408 vector polygons with 233 attribute variables, split into 5 tables. All variable names were translated from Spanish using Google Translate. Field name prefixes, originally written with original language titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of “Conyuge o pareja” was updated to D002 and given the alias “Relationship to the head of household: Spouse or partner[Relación o parentesco con el jefe(a) del hogar: Conyuge o pareja]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration and S = Social). All variables from the original data was reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[original language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This geodatabase is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive. Refer to the metadata and documentation for original and translated codebooks and methodology."
