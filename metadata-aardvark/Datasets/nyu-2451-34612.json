    "This polygon shapefile layer represents Tapestry Market Segmentation data at the Nielson Designated Market Area level. Tapestry is a geodemographic segmentation system that integrates consumer traits with residential characteristics to identify markets and classify US neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with the most similar characteristics are grouped together, while neighborhoods with divergent characteristics are separated. Internally homogenous, externally heterogeneous market segments depict consumers' lifestyles and lifestages. Tapestry Segmentation combines the \"who\" of lifestyle demography with the \"where\" of local geography to create a classification model with 67 distinct, behavioral market segments. Data sources include Census 2010; the American Community Survey; Esri's demographic updates; Experian's ConsumerView database; and consumer surveys, such as the Survey of the American Consumer from GfK MRI, to capture the subtlety and vibrancy of the US marketplace. For complete information on the methodology behind the Tapestry data and attribute definitions, see the file documentation. This layer was derived from the 2015 ESRI Tapestry Data Geodatabase (nyu_2451_34605)"
