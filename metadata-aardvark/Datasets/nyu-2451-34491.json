The data was taken \"as is\" and was not verified for accuracy or omissions. It includes all facilities coded as colleges (factypes 1201 through 1204). The capacity field is the number of full and part time students enrolled for the 2014 fall semester, as reported by the NYS Dept of Education. The unique ID is id, a field created by the City. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
