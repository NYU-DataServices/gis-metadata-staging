    "This geodatabase contains basic population and housing characteristics for barrios in the Dominican Republic, collected by the Oficina Nacional de Estadística (ONE) as part of the Dominican Republic's Censo 2010. The data was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. The census data is provided at the barrio administrative level (ADM5) and includes 12,565 polygons with 756 attribute variables, split into 5 tables. Attribute descriptions retain original language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from Spanish. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of “H23_Si” was updated to D001 and given the alias “There is a newborn girl or boy that has not been previously mentioned: Yes[H23_Si]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration and S = Social). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[original language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This geodatabase is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive. Refer to the metadata and documentation for original and translated codebooks and methodology."
