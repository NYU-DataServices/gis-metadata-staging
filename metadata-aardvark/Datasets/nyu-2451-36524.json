  "dct_description_sm": "This polygon shapefile represents basic population characteristics for sectors in Ecuador, collected by the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Censos (INEC Ecuador) as part of Ecuador's Censo 2010. Indicators in this layer include sex, age, family reproduction (i.e. number of offspring), and relationship to the head of the household. This layer was derived from a geodatabase (see the related data file) and was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. The census data is provided at the sector administrative level (ADM6) and includes 40,649 polygons with 1235 attribute variables, split into 5 layers. Attribute descriptions retain original language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from Spanish. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of \u201cSexo: Hombre\u201d was updated to D001 and given the alias \u201cSex: Man[Sexo: Hombre]\u201d, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration and S = Social). Where possible, all variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format \u201cEnglish translation field description[original language field description]\u201d. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This layer is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive. Refer to the metadata and documentation for original and translated codebooks and methodology.\n",
