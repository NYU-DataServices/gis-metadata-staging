    "This polygon layer is a subset of the Census TIGER census counties file, re-projected to local state plan and modified by subtracting a subset of the Census TIGER water layer (nyu_2451_34507) from it to create land-based boundaries. The unique ID is countyid; the FIPS state-county code. This layer contains counties in the NYC Metropolitan Area. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City."
