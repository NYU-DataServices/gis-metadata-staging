  "dct_description_sm": "This polygon shapefile layer represents the mapped areas in which the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing Program is applicable. The Mandatory Inclusionary Housing program was adopted in 2016 to encourage the creation of housing for families at a range of incomes in areas planned for housing growth. When actions of the Commission significantly increase residential density, the City Planning Commission and the City Council will apply one or more options to require affordable housing as part of new residential construction. Note to Users: These features are provided for reference only and are not intended for determining Mandatory Inclusionary Housing eligibility at the tax lot level. Please refer to PDF Document Appendix F the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York.",
