{"dct_description_sm":"This layer is a subset of the Census TIGER county file, modified by subtracting a subset of the Census TIGER water layer (a_water_coastal) from it to create land-based boundaries. It is the only layer in the database that was not re-projected to local state plane; it uses the original geographic coordinate system that Census layers are projected in, NAD 83. It is provided for users as a frame of reference for plotting local longitude and latitude data, which can subsequently be saved as geographic features and converted to local state plane. The unique ID is bcode; the FIPS state-county code.","dct_format_s":"Shapefile","dct_identifier_sm":"http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34515","dct_language_sm":"English","dct_accessRights_s":"Public","dct_subject_sm":["Census","Administrative bounaries"],"dct_title_s":"2010 New York City Boroughs","gbl_resourceClass_sm":"Datasets","dct_isPartOf_sm":[],"schema_provider_s":"NYU","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"http://hdl.handle.net/2451/34515\",\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://archive.nyu.edu/retrieve/74714/nyu_2451_34515.zip\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\":\"https://maps-public.geo.nyu.edu/geoserver/sdr/wfs\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\":\"https://maps-public.geo.nyu.edu/geoserver/sdr/wms\"}","dct_source_sm":[],"dct_spatial_sm":["New York City"],"dct_temporal_sm":["2010"],"gbl_mdVersion_s":"Aardvark","gbl_resourceType_sm":"Polygon data","gbl_wxsIdentifier_s":"sdr:nyu_2451_34515","gbl_mdModified_dt":"2020-11-25T08:00:43Z","id":"nyu-2451-34515","nyu_addl_dspace_s":"35422","locn_geometry":"ENVELOPE(-74.2556640887564, -73.700009054899, 40.9157739339836, 40.4960925239255)","gbl_indexYear_im":2010}
