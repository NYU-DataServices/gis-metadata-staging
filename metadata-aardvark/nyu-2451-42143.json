{"dct_creator_sm":[],"dct_description_sm":"This point shapefile represents the metro stations along the metro line in the city of Dubai as of 2017. A metro station is a railway facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload passengers or freight. It generally consists of a platform next to the track and a station building (depot) providing related services such as ticket sales and waiting rooms. If a station is on a single track main line, it usually has a passing loop to facilitate the traffic. The original dataset was created by Dubai Pulse and hosted on Bayanat.ae.","dct_format_s":"Shapefile","dct_identifier_sm":"http://hdl.handle.net/2451/42143","dct_language_sm":"English","dct_publisher_sm":"United Arab Emirates Government","dct_accessRights_s":"Public","dct_subject_sm":["Urban transportation","Transportation","Railroad stations","local transit"],"dct_title_s":"Metro Stations in the city of Dubai, 2017","gbl_resourceClass_sm":"Datasets","dct_isPartOf_sm":["United Arab Emirates Open Data"],"dct_issued_s":"2018","schema_provider_s":"NYU","dct_references_s":"{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"http://hdl.handle.net/2451/42143\",\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://archive.nyu.edu/retrieve/84880/nyu_2451_42143.zip\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\":\"https://maps-public.geo.nyu.edu/geoserver/sdr/wfs\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\":\"https://maps-public.geo.nyu.edu/geoserver/sdr/wms\",\"http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85035852\":\"https://archive.nyu.edu/retrieve/84881/nyu_2451_42143_doc.zip\"}","dct_source_sm":[],"dct_spatial_sm":["Dubai, United Arab Emirates"],"dct_temporal_sm":["2017"],"gbl_mdVersion_s":"Aardvark","gbl_resourceType_sm":"Point data","gbl_wxsIdentifier_s":"sdr:nyu_2451_42143","gbl_mdModified_dt":"2018-05-10T15:45:47Z","id":"nyu-2451-42143","nyu_addl_dspace_s":"43223","nyu_addl_format_sm":["Shapefile"],"locn_geometry":"ENVELOPE(55.018336891807, 55.324223108193, 25.204082418335, 24.927317581665)","gbl_indexYear_im":2017}
