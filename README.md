# NYU Libraries GeoBlacklight Metadata Repository

[OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) is the cannonical, most current source for geospatial metadata housed within the NYU Libraries collection in out [Spatial Data Repository](geo.nyu.edu). 

You might currently be looking at [OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) or at NYU's internal fork [NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging) — the latter is where NYU staff works on in-process records to lint and stage in our staging instance.

[OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) should never be committed to directly—it should only take pull requests from [NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging).
