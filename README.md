[OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) is the canonical, most current source for geospatial metadata housed within the NYU Libraries collection in our [Spatial Data Repository](https://geo.nyu.edu). 

ðŸ‘€ You might currently be looking at [OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) or at NYU's internal fork [NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging) â€” the latter is where NYU staff works on in-process records to lint and stage in our staging instance.

## Contributing

> *Note: [OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu](https://github.com/OpenGeoMetadata/edu.nyu) should not committed to by NYU staff directlyâ€”it should receive pull requests from [NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging](https://github.com/NYU-DataServices/gis-metadata-staging) to ensure parity.*
