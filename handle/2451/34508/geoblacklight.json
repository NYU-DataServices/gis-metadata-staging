Large, individual water features that represent lakes or reservoirs were selected from the master water feature set (nyu_2451_34516), to provide basic reference for thematic maps. The unique ID is hydroid, created by the Census. This data was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
