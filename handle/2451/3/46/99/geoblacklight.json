  "dc_description_s": "This point layer was created from the GTFS data feeds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It represents the bus stop locations (individual locations where one or more buses make stops) for local buses in western Queens and for the MTA Bus Company routes, which are known locally as \"express buses\". Because of the way the MTA classifies it's bus lines and data, local buses for Queens are split into two separate files; in this file, most of the stops in western Queens are for local buses. The remaining stops are for express buses, which are long-distance coaches that take passengers from areas of the outer boroughs to midtown and downtown Manhattan and back, with limited stops. A python script was written to take the data files as input and plot and save them as a spatial layer in the local state plane coordinate reference system. The unique ID is stop_id, a field created by the MTA. This dataset is intended for researchers, policy makers, students, and educators for basic geographic analysis and mapping purposes. It was created by the GIS Lab at the Newman Library at Baruch College CUNY as part of the NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers series, so that members of the public could have access to well-documented and readily-usable GIS layers of NYC mass transit features.
