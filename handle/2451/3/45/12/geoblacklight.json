  "dc_description_s": "This polygon layer is a subset of the Census TIGER PUMA file, re-projected to local state plane. The content of this layer has not been modified from its original version present in the US Census TIGER Line Shapefiles, and contains official PUMA boundaries. PUMAs are statistical areas built from census tracts that are designed to have approximately 100k residents. PUMA boundaries from the 2010 Census were first used in the American Community Survey (ACS) 2012 series; earlier series used the 2000 Census boundaries. The Census began assigning official names (in addition to numbers) to PUMAs based on state and local government input beginning in 2010. The unique ID is geoid10; the FIPS state-puma code. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
