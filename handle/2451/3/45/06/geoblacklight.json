The unique ID is rail_id, a field created by attaching a railroad prefix for either Metro North or the LIRR to numbers created by the MTA. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
