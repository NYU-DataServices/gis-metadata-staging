The data was re-projected to NY state plane and contains just the PATH train stations that are in NYC. Annual, average weekday, and average weekend ridership is provided for 2012 to 2014. The unique ID is atis_id, a field created by NJ Transit. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
