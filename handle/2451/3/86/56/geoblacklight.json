  "dc_description_s": "This record contains aerial laser scanning (ALS) and photogrammetry data that corresponds to Flight 150326_125917, which is one part of data that was collected over an area of more than 2km² in Dublin, Ireland in 2015 and includes 3D point-cloud (LAZ), 3D full waveform LiDAR (LAS and Pulsewave), and ortho-rectified 2D rasters. Over 1.4 billion laser points were acquired (inclusive of partially covered areas). ALS was carried out by contractors using a TopEye system S/N 443. Imagery data was captured using a Phase One camera system. The average flying altitude was 300m with the total of 41 flight paths. This data was collected with funding from European Research Council Consolidator project RETURN – Rethinking Tunnelling  in Urban Neighbourhoods [ERC-2012- StG-307836] and additional funding from Science Foundation Ireland [12/ERC/I2534]. For more information on this data, consult the documentation. See the source dataset for a guide to the entire collection. A manifest of SHA-256 checksums are available in the nyu_2451_38656_manifest.json' file, within the preservation record.
