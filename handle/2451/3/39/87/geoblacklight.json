The Inclusionary Housing Designated Areas Program was created in 2005 to encourage the creation and preservation of affordable housing in medium and high-density neighborhoods being rezoned to create new housing opportunities. The program modifies the base floor area ratio (FAR) available for developments and offers a floor area bonus for developments that provide affordable housing either on-site or within the surrounding community.",
