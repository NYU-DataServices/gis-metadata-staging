  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents basic population characteristics for barrios in Guatemala, collected as part of its 2014 Census by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE). Indicators in this layer include employment and unemployment, industry, and occupational category. This layer was derived from a geodatabase (see the related data file) and was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. The census data is provided at the barrio administrative level (ADM5) and includes 15,263 polygons with 229 attribute variables, split into 4 layers. Attribute descriptions retain original language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from Spanish. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names (e.g. Original variable of “Estado Civil: Total Con Estado Conyugal (Poblacion De 12 Años O Mas)” was updated to D001 and given the alias “Marital Status: Total Population By Marital Status (Population Aged 12 Or Older)[Estado Civil: Total Con Estado Conyugal (Poblacion De 12 Años O Mas)]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing and S = Social). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles or long integers. Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[original language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This layer is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive. Refer to the metadata and documentation for original and translated codebooks and methodology.",
