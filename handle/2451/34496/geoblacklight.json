The unique ID is countyid; the FIPS state-county code. This layer contains counties in the NYC Metropolitan Area. This layer was created as part of the NYC Geodatabase (NYC GDB) project, a resource designed for basic geographic analysis and thematic mapping within the five boroughs of New York City.",
