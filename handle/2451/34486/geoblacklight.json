  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile contains locations of 2G mobile cellular towers around the world for 2014. The data is created from submissions made directly to Collins Bartholomew or the GSMA from mobile operators, which provide roaming detail for inclusion in the online mapping application known as Collins Mobile Coverage Web. The data is supplied with a nominal resolution of approximately 1km on the ground. This map can be used to locate and analyze mobile communications coverage on a global scale.",
