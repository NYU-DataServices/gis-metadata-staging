  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile layer represents the projected extent of future mean higher high water (MHHW) with sea level rise for New York City. Extents are based on local sea level rise projections released by the New York City Panel on Climate Change in 2015. The data include the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile projections for the 2020s, 2050s, 2080s, and 2100. For more information on the method used to create these projections see: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12593/epdf. The data illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, rapid subsidence, or future construction.",
