The causers of traffic accidents are classified as misuse of traffic, ignoring compulsory lanes, entering road before traffic clearance, not leaving enough space, jumpring red signal, excessive speed, negligent driving, tyre (tire) burst, and others. The original dataset was collected by the UAE government and hosted on Bayanat.ae. It was joined to the UAE administrative district level 1 boundaries from the Global Administrative Areas database by Taylor Hixson in 2018. This dataset is only to be used for academic purposes.",
