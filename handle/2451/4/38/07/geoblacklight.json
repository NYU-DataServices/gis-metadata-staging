The Network for Economic Opportunity is an initiative of the City of New Orleans, founded to establish productive partnerships among local industries, small businesses, residents, non-profits, philanthropy, and city agencies to achieve common goals within six priority areas: Economic Opportunity, Housing Affordability, Cultural Preservation, Transportation Access, Sustainable Environment, and Safe & Healthy Neighborhoods. The Network manages the connections. Local industries and Claiborne Corridor residents activate the goals. Cross-sector partners enable the work.
