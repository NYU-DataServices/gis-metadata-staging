  "dc_description_s": "This multi-band raster data represents estimates of carbon opportunity cost. The data is captured at a resolution of 5 arcminutes over the global domain and is derived from data collected approximately over the past two decades (2000-2020). The pixel values measure estimates in tonnes of potential vegetationÂ per hectare that are suppressed by pasturelands and present-day feed crops. The bands represent three estimates of carbon in potential vegetation: median, low (5th percentile), and high (95th percentile).
