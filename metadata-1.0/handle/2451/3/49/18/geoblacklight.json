  "dc_description_s": "This geodatabase contains basic population and housing characteristics for populated places (abbreviated as LP in the geodatabase) and barrios (abbreviated as BT in the geodatabase) in Panama, collected as part of its Censos Nacionales de 2010 by the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo. This data was documented and restructured by East View Cartographic, Inc. The census data provides indicators across five distinct subject categories, and contains 1,188 attribute variables. There are 13,124 polygons in total, which are available across two distinct administrative geographies:  populated places (ADM4) and barrios (ADM5). There are ten tables in the geodatabase (a populated places table and a barrios table for each of the five subject categories). Attribute descriptions retain original language names and unique identifier codes. All variable names were translated from Spanish. Field name prefixes, originally written with coded titles, were renamed to create unique names across the geodatabase (e.g. Original variable of “Sexo: Hombre” was updated to BT_D001 and given the alias “Sex: Man[Sexo: Hombre]”, the letter D was given as it relates to the Demographic theme table. D = Demographic, E = Economic, H = Housing, M = Migration and S = Social. BT relates to the Barrios and LP relates to the populated places). All variables from the original data were reviewed for completeness and organized into their relevant themes of Demographic, Economic, Housing, Migration and Social. In the attribute tables, all geographic names and codes are represented as text fields and census data are represented as doubles or long integers.  Automated tools were run to apply aliases in the format “English translation field description[original language field description]”. Vector data was analyzed for accuracy and compared with national boundaries. This geodatabase is part of a partnership project with East View Cartographic and IPUMS International, titled the Global Census Archive.
