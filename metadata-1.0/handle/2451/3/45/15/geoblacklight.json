  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a subset of the Census TIGER county file, modified by subtracting a subset of the Census TIGER water layer (a_water_coastal) from it to create land-based boundaries. It is the only layer in the database that was not re-projected to local state plane; it uses the original geographic coordinate system that Census layers are projected in, NAD 83. It is provided for users as a frame of reference for plotting local longitude and latitude data, which can subsequently be saved as geographic features and converted to local state plane. The unique ID is bcode; the FIPS state-county code.",
