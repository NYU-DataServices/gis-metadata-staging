It includes individual buildings, structures, sites, and objects as well as historic districts that are considered to be significant in American history, architecture, engineering, archaeology, and culture. This dataset is the result of collaboration between the Louisiana State Historic Preservation Office, FEMA and the City of New Orleans ITI-GIS.
