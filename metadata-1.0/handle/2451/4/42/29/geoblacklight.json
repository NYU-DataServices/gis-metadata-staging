The data table is in Arabic and includes some structural and historical information for each dam in the نبذة_ (brief) field, such as construction material, dimensions, and construction year. There is also some information about leisure and touristic activities near the dam. This data was originally collected and hosted by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE). The data was accessed and downloaded from the MOCCAE's ArcGIS REST services directory in December 2018. The actual collection date and temporal coverage of the data is unknown and may vary. ",
