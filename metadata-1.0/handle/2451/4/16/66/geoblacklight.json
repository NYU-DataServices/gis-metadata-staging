  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile layer represents Transit Zone boundaries. Transit Zone boundaries are mapped to encompass neighborhoods that are dense, proximate to public transportation options, and where car ownership rates are lowest. Within the Transit Zone, no off-street parking spaces are required to be built for Income Restricted Housing Units (also referred to as IRHU) and Affordable Independent Residences for Seniors (also referred to as AIRS), and discretionary actions allow for the removal of parking spaces that were previously required, or the reduction of spaces that would normally need to be built for certain other housing types.",
